The Mildred Hailey community experiences a higher crime rate than the rest of Jamaica Plain. This study addresses a few key issues with the planning of the area, and proposes interventions that can help alleviate some environmental issues that hinder the social and economica value of the community. I use social crime theories&mdash;"eyes on the street," the Broken Window Theory, Routine Activity Theory, and the concept of the panopticon&mdash; to inform my analysis and intervention.</p>

                <p> Crack'd was installed in Gallery 5 at the Boston University College of Fine Arts. <a href="www.tannergauvin.com" >Tanner Gauvin</a> (BU CFA'18) and I explored the effects of visual fragmentation with an exhibition showcasing fragmented imagery, geometric forms, and the physical disruption of space using string and mirrors. <br/>I installed a large geometric piece using black vinyl that extended from a moveable wall to a separate wall of the gallery. From a certain point of view, the two walls merged into one continuous composition, while from other angles, the vinyl separated into two disconnected walls.
                <br/>Situated between the two walls of vinyl was a corner in which hung a web of string that created shadows on the walls. Viewers were encouraged to enter the space and sit down. As the only enclosed space in the gallery, it was a space that allowed the viewer to remove him/herself from others, while simultaneously becoming a semi-omniscient voyeur&mdash;the many mirrors provided views throughout the gallery in unexpected places.</p>

                I was fascinated by the March, 2013 podcast, <i>No Coincidence, No Story!</i>. Just the concept of the coincidence raises so many questions: how do coincidences come to exist? Do they only exist if one or more people notice? Even if they notice, what makes an occurrence a coincidence? What is the probability of something happening? Does it even matter? What does all of this say about the human existence, and how we &mdash; individually and collectively &mdash; perceive the world around us?
                     <br>
                     Carl Jung had a theory called the Unus Mundus, in which every entity and activity is connected by one unifying force. At the same time that I found this out from trusty Wikipedia, I was writing a paper surveying geometric patterns on architecture. I had been writing about the mathematical approach to religious art on Moorish buildings such as the Alhambra in Spain. Islamic belief essentially follows the same premise as Jung's Unus Mundus&#58; that all life is unified as one system under the perview of God.
                     <br>
                     I constructed three identical circles and intersected them at their centers, and created sixty unique designs using that original circle structure, creating a printed Unus Mundus.</p>

                 <p>The prompt: Create a six word auto-biography and display the quote in some typographic way. <br/><br/> I've always had self-esteem issues, and I've worried, in varying degrees throughout my life, about how people judge me. I'm also participant to the very large community of judges around the world. Everyone has something to judge and scorn, and everyone has flaws in the eyes of everyone else. If there was a population of individuals who are truly perfect, maybe being judged for certain characteristics or actions is something to worry about. But no one is perfect. So even if my best friends judge me for something I do or something I have, well it certainly doesn't matter, because if it was that significant to them, we wouldn't be friends.</p>

            <p>My name is Qian&mdash;I will be graduating from Boston University May 2018 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design. <br/><br/>I was born in London and raised near Baltimore, but I call Boston my home. 
                <br/><br/> My passions&#58; I've been a serious runner for a few years now&mdash;I finished the 2016 Baltimore Marathon in 4&#58;22, and finished the 2017 Baystate Marathon in 4&#58;04. My goal is to qualify for Boston within the next five years. I have a Black Belt in Taekwondo and love my TKD family more than anything. I am in the Mercury Orchestra, a community orchestra based in Somerville, and my favorite solo violin piece is the Bach Chaconne. Can't get enough of it, just like I can't get enough of Justin Beiber's Sorry. I'm currently reading Jane Jacob's 'The Death and Life of Great American Cities'. I love any book on philosophical or biological anthropology. I've killed two succulents, which are characteristically extremely hard-to-kill plants, but I really enjoy having the ones that stay alive. 
                <br/><br/> Celebrity role-models&#58; Rowan Atkinson. Graduated with a Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, and then transitioned into comedy theatre. If you've ever watched the original Mr. Bean TV series, you've seen his engineering spark in a couple episodes. His car contraption idea opened me up to the unconventional. 
                <br/><br/> The sort of work that gets me going&#58; I get excited reading about innovations in biomedicine, genetics, anthropology, and linguistics. I get a lot of crazy thoughts that I put away as potential "solutions" to lots of random things, and I really get a brain-buzz just conjuring up ideas. But what I'm most interested in investigating right now is the relationships between urban design, policy, sustainability, and public health. The effects  our designed infrastructure have on the welfare of our residents and on our environment are complex and hard to isolate, but it's always really exciting to find new connections to research.
